# Leander Flossie Engine

One of the key design choices I made with my engine was my inplementation of the Event System. 
Since I was interested in the signals from GODOT, I tried to make a cpp version of it that got more complicated the more time went into it.

Because of this implementation I was able to use this for commands and ather data transfer too.

Unfortunately I wasn't able to finish my game. Most of the intended features are inplemented but not yet visable.
